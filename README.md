# VPython
The Jupyter version of VPython, the VPython API available in a Jupyter Notebook

Provide the VPython API for use in a Jupyter Notebook. Here is a simple example that will run in a Jupyter Notebook cell:

sphere()

This will create a 3D window in the Notebook containing a 3D sphere, with mouse controls available to zoom and rotate the camera.

At this moment the API implemented here is simiilar to that of Classic VPython (vpython.org), but work is in progress to follow the API of GlowScript VPython (glowscript.org). Until further notice, you should expect that test programs you run today with Jupyter VPython will not work in the future.
