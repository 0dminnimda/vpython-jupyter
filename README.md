# VPython
The Jupyter version of VPython, the VPython API available in a Jupyter Notebook

Provide the VPython API for use in a Jupyter Notebook. Here is a simple example that will run in a Jupyter Notebook cell:

sphere()

This will create a 3D window in the Notebook containing a 3D sphere, with mouse controls available to zoom and rotate the camera.

Work is in progress to follow the API of GlowScript VPython (glowscript.org). Some features are not yet fully implemented.
